To achieve this, you can create a custom OpenShift operator using the Operator SDK. This operator will watch for changes in the JFrog repository and update the deployment whenever a new image is available. Here's a basic outline of how you can implement this:

Define Custom Resource Definition (CRD): Define a CRD that represents the deployment configuration and the sidecar image to watch for.
Implement Operator Logic: Write the logic for the operator to watch for changes in the JFrog repository and update the deployment when a new image is available.
Use Kubernetes Client Library: Use the Kubernetes client library to interact with the Kubernetes API and update the deployment.
Watch JFrog Repository: Use a library or tool to watch the JFrog repository for changes and trigger the operator logic when a new image is available.
Rollout New Image: Update the deployment's container image to the latest version when a new image is available.

Get the List of Artifacts in the Repository: Periodically fetch the list of artifacts in your JFrog repository using the Artifactory REST API. You can use the /api/storage/{repoKey}/{itemPath} endpoint to get information about the artifacts in the repository.
Check for Updates: Compare the list of artifacts with the previous list to identify any new artifacts or changes to existing artifacts.
Trigger Deployment Update: When you detect a new artifact or a change in an existing artifact that matches the "hello sidecar" image, trigger the logic to update the deployment with the new image.



To watch for updates to the "hello sidecar" image in your private JFrog repository, you can modify the operator to periodically check the repository for new versions of the image. Here's a basic outline of how you can implement this:

Define a Function to Check for Updates: Create a function that fetches the list of artifacts in the JFrog repository and compares them with the current version of the "hello sidecar" image.
Periodically Invoke the Update Check Function: Use a goroutine to periodically invoke the update check function.
Trigger Deployment Update: If a new version of the "hello sidecar" image is found, trigger the logic to update the deployment with the new image.
