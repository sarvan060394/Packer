# Packer
To create a virtual machine with SQL using Packer, you will need to follow these general steps:

Create a Packer configuration file (usually a JSON or HCL file) that defines the settings for the virtual machine and SQL installation. This file will contain the following information:

The base image for the virtual machine.
The type of virtual machine and its size (CPU, memory, disk size, etc.).
Any necessary settings for the SQL installation, such as the version and any required configuration settings.
Add a provisioning step to the configuration file to install SQL on the virtual machine. Depending on the type of SQL you are installing, this step may involve downloading and running a setup file, configuring the installation settings, and/or setting up any required databases or users.

Use the Packer command-line tool to run the configuration file and build the virtual machine image. This will involve specifying the path to the configuration file and any necessary variables (such as API keys for cloud providers).

Once the image is built, you can use it to create new virtual machines that have SQL installed and configured.

Here is an example Packer configuration file for creating a virtual machine with SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition installed:

This configuration file uses the Azure ARM builder to create a Windows Server 2019 virtual machine, and then uses the PowerShell provisioner to download and install SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition with default settings. Note that this is just an example, and your configuration file may differ depending on your specific requirements and environment.

#Packer for creating Vsphere VM with Mysql installed:
This configuration file does the following:

Configures the vSphere-iso builder to create a new virtual machine in vSphere based on an Ubuntu Server 20.04 ISO image, with the specified name and settings.
Uses the shell provisioner to install MySQL Server 8.0 and create a test database.
Uses the vSphere-clone post-processor to publish the resulting virtual machine image to vSphere.
To use this configuration file, save it as a JSON file (e.g. mysql-vm.json), and run the following command from the same directory as the file:

packer build mysql-vm.json
