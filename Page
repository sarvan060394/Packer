Sidecar Failover Scenarios and Mitigations
App to Sidecar Integration
App to Sidecar Connectivity
Scenario: Determining Sidecar Status
The consumer app needs to ascertain the status of the sidecar to ensure seamless communication.

Mitigation:
The consumer app won't necessitate an explicit health check for the sidecar. Instead, it will determine the sidecar's status through HTTP requests.

Sidecar Crash
Scenario: Sidecar Container Crash
If the sidecar container crashes, the main app loses communication with the sidecar.

Mitigation:
Implement liveness and readiness probes in the sidecar container:

Liveness probe: Automatically restarts the sidecar container if it crashes.
Readiness probe: Ensures that the sidecar container is ready to start accepting traffic.
Sidecar Resource Exhaustion
Scenario: Exhaustion of Sidecar Resources
If the sidecar container exhausts its resources (CPU, memory), it may become unresponsive.

Mitigation:
Conduct a detailed analysis of performance and load testing to determine the required resource allocation for the sidecar.
Implement a guaranteed pod in OpenShift to ensure that the sidecar has the necessary allocated resources.
Delay in Sidecar's Response
Scenario: Delayed Response from Sidecar
If the sidecar takes too long to process requests, the consumer app needs to know the sidecar's status.

Mitigation:
Set appropriate timeout values.
Implement retry logic in the main app to handle temporary failures effectively.
Sidecar to Services Integration
No Response from Redis Cluster
Scenario: Absence of Response from Service
The sidecar needs to handle situations where there is no response from the Redis cluster.

Mitigation:
Utilize an exponential backoff algorithm to increase the time between retry attempts.
Sidecar should adhere to timeout rules when connecting to the Redis cluster.
Redis Cluster is Back Online
Scenario: Redis Cluster Restoration
Upon the Redis cluster coming back online, the sidecar should be restarted to attempt reconnection.

Mitigation:
After several retries, the sidecar ceases attempts to connect to the Redis cluster. Two approaches for restarting the sidecar are:

Resource Monitoring Application:

Develop a resource monitoring application deployed via deployment in OpenShift within the same namespace.
Monitor the Redis cluster's status and restart the sidecar accordingly.
Operator Implementation:

Create an operator to periodically check the Redis cluster's status.
Restart the sidecar to reconnect to the Redis cluster upon restoration.
These mitigation strategies ensure robust failover mechanisms and seamless integration between the app and sidecar, as well as between the sidecar and services.
